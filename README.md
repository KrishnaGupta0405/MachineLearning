__Welcome to My Machine Learning Journey!__

Hey there! I'm Krishna Gupta, i had spent my last six months in learning the art of Machine Learning and yeah it's still going on. In this repo i will be giving my Recipe's of diffrent Machine Learning Algorithms, some project starting from the basic one's followed by advanced.. , and crisp short notes to for better understanding of the codes.

And as per Chat GPT-> Think of this as your spicy ML toolkit—packed with hands-on code, sharp insights, and a dash of creativity. Dive in and let’s build something amazing together!
And yeah, using ChatGPT for learing purposes was one of the majour goal of Sir Sam Altman, i hope you got the point :)
